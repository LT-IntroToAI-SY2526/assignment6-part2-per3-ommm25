## Question 3: Model Performance

What was your model's R² score? What does this tell you about how well your model predicts house prices? Is there room for improvement?

**YOUR ANSWER:**
0.9936 is my R² score. Which means my model is correct at predicting the price 99.36% of the time. There is a bit of room for improvement as it is not 100% so it has .64% erorr but that is very very small but yes there is room for improvement.

## Question 4: Adding Features

If you could add TWO more features to improve your house price predictions, what would they be and why?

**Feature 1:**
Ready to live in


**Why it would help:**
The circumstances of the house also play a part because if a house is live in ready it costs more than one thats a fixer upper due to the challenges it fixes and how a fixer upper is a bargain compared to live in houses when buying a house.


**Feature 2:**
Property Damage


**Why it would help:**
It helps take into the account the amount of modifications which should be taken into consideration when considering the price of the house because fixing houses is not cheap and could cost a good amount.

## Question 5: Model Trust

Would you trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old? Why or why not? (Hint: Think about the range of your training data)

**YOUR ANSWER:**
I would use it for a decent estimate as it is pretty accurate but there are tons of other variables that should also be taken into consideration, so yes I would use it but not trust 100% of it. It may be able to get a close estimate but the range for the bathrooms, bedrooms, and sq ft are not able to be taken within the models practice so it won't generate he value at its best it will be off.
